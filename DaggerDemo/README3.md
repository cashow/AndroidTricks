## Subcomponents

Subcomponents are components that inherit and extend the object graph of a parent component. You can use them to partition your application’s object graph into subgraphs either to encapsulate different parts of your application from each other or to use more than one scope within a component.

An object bound in a subcomponent can depend on any object that is bound in its parent component or any ancestor component, in addition to objects that are bound in its own modules. On the other hand, objects bound in parent components can’t depend on those bound in subcomponents; nor can objects bound in one subcomponent depend on objects bound in sibling subcomponents.

In other words, the object graph of a subcomponent’s parent component is a subgraph of the object graph of the subcomponent itself.

### Declaring a subcomponent

Just like for top-level components, you create a subcomponent by writing an abstract class or interface that declares abstract methods that return the types your application cares about. Instead of annotating a subcomponent with @Component, you annotate it with @Subcomponent and install @Modules. Similar to component builders, a @Subcomponent.Builder specifies an interface to supply necessary modules to construct the subcomponent.

```java
@Subcomponent(modules = RequestModule.class)
interface RequestComponent {
  RequestHandler requestHandler();

  @Subcomponent.Builder
  interface Builder {
    Builder requestModule(RequestModule module);
    RequestComponent build();
  }
}
```

### Adding a subcomponent to a parent component

To add a subcomponent to a parent component, add the subcomponent class to the subcomponents attribute of a @Module that the parent component installs. Then the subcomponent’s builder can be requested from within the parent.

```java
@Module(subcomponents = RequestComponent.class)
class ServerModule {}

@Singleton
@Component(modules = ServerModule.class)
interface ServerComponent {
  RequestRouter requestRouter();
}

@Singleton
class RequestRouter {
  @Inject RequestRouter(
      Provider<RequestComponent.Builder> requestComponentProvider) {}

  void dataReceived(Data data) {
    RequestComponent requestComponent =
        requestComponentProvider.get()
            .data(data)
            .build();
    requestComponent.requestHandler()
        .writeResponse(200, "hello, world");
  }
}
```

### Subcomponents and scope

One reason to break your application’s component up into subcomponents is to use scopes. With normal, unscoped bindings, each user of an injected type may get a new, separate instance. But if the binding is scoped, then all users of that binding within the scope’s lifetime get the same instance of the bound type.

The standard scope is @Singleton. Users of singleton-scoped bindings all get the same instance.

In Dagger, a component can be associated with a scope by annotating it with a @Scope annotation. In that case, the component implementation holds references to all scoped objects so they can be reused. Modules with @Provides methods annotated with a scope may only be installed into a component annotated with the same scope.

(Types with @Inject constructors may also be annotated with scope annotations. These “implicit bindings” may be used by any component annotated with that scope or any of its descendant components. The scoped instance will be bound in the correct scope.)

No subcomponent may be associated with the same scope as any ancestor component, although two subcomponents that are not mutually reachable can be associated with the same scope because there is no ambiguity about where to store the scoped objects. (The two subcomponents effectively have different scope instances even if they use the same scope annotation.)

For example, in the component tree below, BadChildComponent has the same @RootScope annotation as its parent, RootComponent, and that is an error. But SiblingComponentOne and SiblingComponentTwo can both use @ChildScope because there is no way to confuse a binding in one with a binding of the same type in another.

```java
@RootScope @Component
interface RootComponent {
  BadChildComponent.Builder badChildComponent(); // ERROR!
  SiblingComponentOne.Builder siblingComponentOne();
  SiblingComponentTwo.Builder siblingComponentTwo();
}

@RootScope @Subcomponent
interface BadChildComponent {...}

@ChildScope @Subcomponent
interface SiblingComponentOne {...}

@ChildScope @Subcomponent
interface SiblingComponentTwo {...}
```

Because a subcomponent is created from within its parent, its lifetime is strictly smaller than its parent’s. That means that it makes sense to consider subcomponents’ scopes as “smaller” and parent components’ scopes as “larger”. In fact, you almost always want the root component to use the @Singleton scope.

In the example below, RootComponent is in @Singleton scope. @SessionScope is nested within @Singleton scope, and @RequestScope is nested within @SessionScope. Note that FooRequestComponent and BarRequestComponent are both associated with @RequestScope, which works because they are siblings; neither is an ancestor of the other.

```java
@Singleton @Component
interface RootComponent {
  SessionComponent.Builder sessionComponent();
}

@SessionScope @Subcomponent
interface SessionComponent {
  FooRequestComponent.Builder fooRequestComponent();
  BarRequestComponent.Builder barRequestComponent();
}

@RequestScope @Subcomponent
interface FooRequestComponent {...}

@RequestScope @Subcomponent
interface BarRequestComponent {...}
```

### Subcomponents for encapsulation

Another reason to use subcomponents is to encapsulate different parts of your application from each other. For example, if two services in your server (or two screens in your application) share some bindings, say those used for authentication and authorization, but each have other bindings that really have nothing to do with each other, it might make sense to create separate subcomponents for each service or screen, and to put the shared bindings into the parent component.

In the following example, the Database is provided within the @Singleton component, but all of its implementation details are encapsulated within the DatabaseComponent. Rest assured that no UI will have access to the DatabaseConnectionPool to schedule their own queries without going through the Database since that binding only exists in the subcomponent.

```java
@Singleton
@Component(modules = DatabaseModule.class)
interface ApplicationComponent {
  Database database();
}

@Module(subcomponents = DatabaseComponent.class)
class DatabaseModule {
  @Provides
  @Singleton 
  Database provideDatabase(
      @NumberOfCores int numberOfCores,
      DatabaseComponent.Builder databaseComponentBuilder) {
    return databaseComponentBuilder
        .databaseImplModule(new DatabaseImplModule(numberOfCores / 2))
        .build()
        .database();
  }
}

@Module
class DatabaseImplModule {
  DatabaseImplModule(int concurrencyLevel) {}
  @Provides DatabaseConnectionPool provideDatabaseConnectionPool() {}
  @Provides DatabaseSchema provideDatabaseSchema() {}
}

@Subcomponent(modules = DatabaseImplModule.class)
interface DatabaseComponent {
  @PrivateToDatabase Database database();
}
```

### Defining subcomponents with abstract factory methods

In addition to @Module.subcomponents, a subcomponent can be installed in a parent by declaring an abstract factory method in the parent component that returns the subcomponent. If the subcomponent requires a module that does not have a no-arg public constructor, and that module is not installed into the parent component, then the factory method must have a parameter of that module’s type. The factory method may have other parameters for any other modules that are installed on the subcomponent but not on the parent component. (The subcomponent will automatically share the instance of any module shared between it and its parent.) Alternatively, the abstract method on the parent component may return the @Subcomponent.Builder and no modules need to be listed as parameters.

Using @Module.subcomponents is better since it allows Dagger to detect if the subcomponent is ever requested. Installing a subcomponent via a method on the parent component is an explicit request for that component, even if that method is never called. Dagger can’t detect that, and thus must generate the subcomponent even if you never use it.

### Details

### Extending multibindings

Like other bindings, multibindings in a parent component are visible to bindings in subcomponents. But subcomponents can also add multibindings to maps and sets bound in their parent. Any such additional contributions are visible only to bindings within the subcomponent or its subcomponents, and are not visible within the parent.

```java
@Component(modules = ParentModule.class)
interface Parent {
  Map<String, Integer> map();
  Set<String> set();

  Child child();
}

@Module
class ParentModule {
  @Provides @IntoMap
  @StringKey("one") static int one() {
    return 1;
  }

  @Provides @IntoMap
  @StringKey("two") static int two() {
    return 2;
  }

  @Provides @IntoSet
  static String a() {
    return "a"
  }

  @Provides @IntoSet
  static String b() {
    return "b"
  }
}

@Subcomponent(modules = ChildModule.class)
interface Child {
  Map<String, Integer> map();
  Set<String> set();
}

@Module
class ChildModule {
  @Provides @IntoMap
  @StringKey("three") static int three() {
    return 3;
  }

  @Provides @IntoMap
  @StringKey("four") static int four() {
    return 4;
  }

  @Provides @IntoSet
  static String c() {
    return "c"
  }

  @Provides @IntoSet
  static String d() {
    return "d"
  }
}

Parent parent = DaggerParent.create();
Child child = parent.child();
assertThat(parent.map().keySet()).containsExactly("one", "two");
assertThat(child.map().keySet()).containsExactly("one", "two", "three", "four");
assertThat(parent.set()).containsExactly("a", "b");
assertThat(child.set()).containsExactly("a", "b", "c", "d");
```

### Repeated modules

When the same module type is installed in a component and any of its subcomponents, then each of those components will automatically use the same instance of the module. This means that it is an error if you call a subcomponent builder method for a repeated module or if a subcomponent factory method defines a repeated module as a parameter. (The former cannot be checked at compile time, and is thus a runtime error.)

```java
@Component(modules = {RepeatedModule.class, ...})
interface ComponentOne {
  ComponentTwo componentTwo(RepeatedModule repeatedModule); // COMPILE ERROR!
  ComponentThree.Builder componentThreeBuilder();
}

@Subcomponent(modules = {RepeatedModule.class, ...})
interface ComponentTwo { ... }

@Subcomponent(modules = {RepeatedModule.class, ...})
interface ComponentThree {
  @Subcomponent.Builder
  interface Builder {
    Builder repeatedModule(RepeatedModule repeatedModule);
    ComponentThree build();
  }
}

DaggerComponentOne.create().componentThreeBuilder()
    .repeatedModule(new RepeatedModule()) // UnsupportedOperationException!
    .build();
```
